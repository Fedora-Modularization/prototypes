### Prototype-3: Investigate location of user files
In order for this to "feel" like a normal user system, a user must have the freedom, with some constraints, to add "content" to the places they expect to on the system as well as have the applications they use recognize those locations as "where things go." For example, I often symlink my "Downloads" directory (in Gnome) to my mounted "projects" directory so that it can grow with my "projects allocation" (and be reused across installs) rather than with my "home dir allocation." However, if you do that, you need to ensure that Firefox default downloads directory follows the symlink when downloading, the Files app keeps "Downloads" in the "pick list," etc. As a result, if we move home-dirs to somewhere else, we need to ensure the user experience is the same, or has easily documented differences. I would expect we want to have a similar experience for `/opt`.
